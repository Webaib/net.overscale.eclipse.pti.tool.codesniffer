== FAQ

=== Path to the CodeSniffer

There's to main option how you can set.

. You can set the path (to the CodeSniffer phar or php file) with eclipse (Window/Preferences/PHP Tools/PHP CodeSniffer) as well as in the project settings.
. Or you can use the environment variable "PHPCS_PATH" (in eclipse this path property must be empty).

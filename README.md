PHP Tool Codesniffer
====================

Thanks for great tools from [PHPsrc](https://github.com/PHPsrc).
Sadly, it hasn't been updated for years. I have to use these great tools in my daily work, so I've decided to try tailoring.

== Installation

You'll have to compile the plugin or you can take precompiled [version] (https://github.com/Webaib/org.phpsrc.eclipse.pti.tool.codesniffer/blob/master/plugins.7z?raw=true)

== FAQ
=== Path to the CodeSniffer
There's to main option how you can set.
1. You can set the path (to the CodeSniffer phar or php file) with eclipse (Window/Preferences/PHP Tools/PHP CodeSniffer) as well as in the project settings.
2. Or you can use the environment variable "PHPCS_PATH" (in eclipse this path property must be empty).
